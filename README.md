# Welcome to Beer Here!
View the deployed site here: https://boudreau14.github.io/BreweryApp/<br />

## The website built to put you into a local brewery to catch the game!
 ### Using 3 separate API's, we were able to help our users see what breweries were in the US city of their choice, where they were located, and also gave them the times of that days Major League Baseball games.
 The API's used include:<br />
 1. Open Brewerydb<br />
 2. Here Maps<br />
 3. Sports Data<br />
 
With one search, you are able to connect with this vast list of breweries and plan your next evening (or afternoon, we do not judge here) out with friends!<br />
 
We hope you enjoy our creation!<br />
Sincerely,<br />
The Brew Broâ€™s Team<br />
